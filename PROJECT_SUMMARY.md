# Expandi Dashboard - Complete Project Summary

**Date:** October 14, 2025  
**Status:** Backend Complete (100%) | Frontend Structure Complete (80%)  
**Ready For:** Next developer to complete frontend config and testing  
**Time to Complete:** 1-2 days

---

## 📊 Project Overview

**Client:** ORION (LinkedIn outreach agency)

**Problem:** ORION uses Expandi.io to run LinkedIn campaigns for multiple clients. They need professional dashboards to show campaign performance (invites sent, connections made, response rates) without exposing internal data or automation details.

**Solution:** A custom web application with:
1. **Admin Dashboard** - For ORION to manage companies and generate shareable links
2. **Client Dashboards** - Public URLs (no login) showing performance metrics

---

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express + SQLite (local) / PostgreSQL (production)
- **Frontend:** React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + Recharts
- **Deployment:** Railway (backend) + Vercel (frontend)

### Data Flow
```
Expandi.io → Webhooks → Backend API → Database → Frontend Dashboard
```

### Key Metrics Tracked
1. **Invites Sent** - Connection requests sent
2. **Connections** - Accepted connections  
3. **Connection Rate** - (Connections ÷ Invites) × 100
4. **Replies** - Responses received
5. **Response Rate** - (Replies ÷ Connections) × 100

## 🚀 Getting Started (Next Developer)

**READ THIS FIRST:** `NEXT_STEPS.md`

It contains:
- Step-by-step setup instructions
- All code you need to create
- Testing procedures
- Troubleshooting guide

**Then Read:** `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`

It contains:
- Complete component implementations
- Code examples
- Design guidelines

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
cd backend
npm install
npm run init-db
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend  
cd frontend
npm install
# (Create config files from NEXT_STEPS.md)
npm run dev
```

---

## 📊 Data Hierarchy

Understanding this is critical:

```
Company (e.g., "ORION", "RWX")
  └─ LinkedIn Account (e.g., "Tobias Millington", "Simon Teed")
      └─ Campaign (e.g., "2025-10-08+Saul Mawby+A00...")
          └─ Events (invites, connections, replies)
              └─ Contact Data
```

**Key Points:**
- One Company has many LinkedIn Accounts
- One LinkedIn Account has many Campaigns  
- One Campaign has many Events
- Events reference Contacts
- Clients only see data for their Company

---

## 🔄 User Flows

### Flow 1: New Campaign Starts
1. Expandi sends webhook → Backend receives
2. Backend creates/finds LinkedIn Account (status: "unassigned")
3. Backend creates Campaign under that account
4. Backend logs Event
5. Admin sees "unassigned account" alert
6. Admin assigns account to Company
7. Client dashboard now shows that data

### Flow 2: Client Views Dashboard
1. Client opens shareable URL: `app.com/c/abc123`
2. Frontend fetches data via API
3. Dashboard shows KPIs and charts
4. Client clicks LinkedIn account → Account view
5. Client clicks campaign → Campaign view
6. Client exports CSV

### Flow 3: Admin Management
1. Admin opens `/admin`
2. Creates new company → Gets shareable link
3. Copies link to send to client
4. Assigns new LinkedIn accounts to companies
5. Views system stats

---

## 🔑 Key Features

### MVP (Current Scope)
- ✅ Webhook receiver (auto-create accounts/campaigns)
- ✅ Admin company management
- ✅ Account assignment
- ✅ Shareable dashboard links (no login)
- ✅ 4 core KPIs
- ✅ Activity charts
- ✅ Drill-down navigation
- ✅ Date filtering
- ✅ CSV export

### Phase 2 (Future)
- 🔲 Admin authentication
- 🔲 Employee accounts with permissions
- 🔲 Contact detail tables
- 🔲 Advanced analytics (industry, title breakdown)
- 🔲 Email notifications
- 🔲 CRM integrations

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Local Testing (No Expandi)
```bash
# Send test webhook
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/expandi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @backend/test-webhook.json
```

### Testing with Real Expandi
1. Use loca.lt to expose local backend
2. Configure webhook in Expandi
3. Trigger events in Expandi
4. Watch data flow through system

## 📈 Success Criteria

Project is complete when:
- [x] Backend starts without errors
- [x] Database initializes correctly
- [x] Webhooks process successfully
- [ ] Frontend starts without errors
- [ ] Admin can create companies
- [ ] Admin can assign accounts
- [ ] Shareable links work
- [ ] Client dashboards display data
- [ ] Charts render correctly
- [ ] Date filters work
- [ ] CSV export downloads
- [ ] All navigation works

---

## 🐛 Known Issues & Considerations

1. **No Authentication in MVP** - Admin dashboard is open. This is intentional for MVP. Will add in Phase 2.

2. **SQLite for Local Dev** - Easy setup, but will migrate to PostgreSQL for production.

3. **No Contact Tables** - Contacts stored but not displayed. This is by design - clients only see aggregated metrics.

4. **Campaign Instance Parsing** - Format: "YYYY-MM-DD+Name+Code". Current parser is basic but works.

5. **Date Handling** - All dates stored as ISO 8601 strings for consistency.

---

## 📚 Documentation Files

**Must Read:**
1. `NEXT_STEPS.md` - Your implementation guide
2. `FRONTEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` - Component details

**Reference:**
3. `README.md` - Project overview
4. `PRD.md` - Product requirements
5. `ARCHITECTURE.md` - Technical design
6. `backend/README.md` - Backend setup
7. `frontend/README.md` - Frontend setup

**All code has extensive inline comments!**

---

## 💡 Development Tips

1. **Start backend first** - It's complete and tested
2. **Test with curl** - Verify API works before frontend
3. **One component at a time** - Build incrementally
4. **Check browser console** - All errors show there
5. **Use backend logs** - Every action is logged with emoji
6. **Database inspection:**
   ```bash
   sqlite3 backend/database/dev.db
   SELECT * FROM companies;
   ```

---

## 🚢 Deployment Plan
