# Expandi Dashboard - Product Requirements Document

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Expandi Dashboard  
**Client:** ORION (LinkedIn outreach agency)  
**Purpose:** Create a performance analytics dashboard that shows LinkedIn campaign metrics to clients without exposing internal operational data.

**Problem Statement:**  
ORION uses Expandi.io to run LinkedIn outreach campaigns for multiple clients. They need a way to showcase campaign performance (invites sent, connections made, response rates) to clients without sharing the internal CRM data, raw contact lists, or Make.com automation details.

**Solution:**  
A custom web application that receives Expandi webhook data, aggregates it into campaign performance metrics, and displays it through:
1. **Admin Dashboard** - For ORION to manage companies, LinkedIn accounts, and generate shareable links
2. **Client Dashboard** - Public, no-login dashboards accessible via unique URLs that show KPIs and trends

---

## User Personas

### Primary User: ORION (Admin)
- Manages 6+ client companies (growing 1-2 per month)
- Each company has 1-4 LinkedIn accounts running campaigns
- Needs to assign LinkedIn accounts to companies
- Generates shareable dashboard links for clients
- Monitors overall performance across all campaigns

### Secondary User: ORION's Client (Viewer)
- Receives a shareable URL from ORION
- Views their campaign performance metrics
- No login required
- Only sees data for their company
- Uses dashboard to justify ORION's service value

### Future User: ORION Employee (Limited Admin)
- Will need login access to view specific departments/accounts
- Not included in MVP

---

## Data Hierarchy

```
Company (e.g., "ORION Internal", "RWX", "Travis Consulting")
  └─ LinkedIn Account (e.g., "Tobias Millington", "Simon Teed")
      └─ Campaign (e.g., "2025-10-08+Saul Mawby+A00...")
          └─ Events (invited, connected, replied)
              └─ Contact Data (aggregated for KPIs only, not displayed)
```

**Key Points:**
- Each Company has multiple LinkedIn Accounts
- Each LinkedIn Account has multiple Campaigns
- Each Campaign tracks multiple Events (invites, connections, replies)
- Contact details are stored but NOT displayed to end users

---

## Core Features

## Key Metrics & Calculations

### Primary KPIs

| Metric | Formula | Data Source |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Invites Sent** | Count of events with `invited_at` timestamp | Webhook: Connection Request Sent |
| **Connections** | Count of events with `connected_at` timestamp | Webhook: Connection Request Accepted |
| **Connection Rate** | (Connections ÷ Invites Sent) × 100 | Calculated |
| **Replies** | Count of events where `conversation_status` != "Awaiting Reply" | Webhook: Contact Replied |
| **Response Rate** | (Replies ÷ Connections) × 100 | Calculated |

### Time-Based Metrics
- Daily/Weekly/Monthly aggregate KPIs
- Trend analysis (week-over-week growth)
- Time-to-connection (average time between invite and acceptance)

---

## Technical Requirements

### Backend
- **Framework:** Node.js + Express
- **Database:** SQLite (local dev), PostgreSQL (production)
- **Hosting:** Railway (production), local for development
- **API:** RESTful JSON API

### Frontend
- **Framework:** React + Vite
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **Charts:** Recharts
- **Hosting:** Vercel

### Data Storage
- Raw webhook data stored for audit trail
- Aggregated metrics cached for performance
- Shareable URLs stored with company mappings

### Security
- No authentication for MVP
- Unique, unguessable URLs for client dashboards (UUID-based)
- Rate limiting on webhook endpoint
- Input validation on all endpoints

## User Flows

### Flow 1: New LinkedIn Account Arrives
1. Expandi sends webhook with new `campaign_instance` containing unknown LinkedIn account name
2. Backend parses webhook, extracts LinkedIn account name
3. Creates new LinkedIn Account record with status "Unassigned"
4. Creates Campaign record under that account
5. Stores event data
6. Admin receives notification (future) or checks admin dashboard
7. Admin assigns LinkedIn account to appropriate company
8. Client dashboard now includes data from that account

### Flow 2: Client Views Dashboard
1. Client receives URL from ORION: `https://app.com/c/abc123`
2. Client opens URL in browser
3. Dashboard loads company-level KPIs for all assigned LinkedIn accounts
4. Client selects date range (e.g., "Last 30 days")
5. Charts update to show filtered data
6. Client clicks on a LinkedIn account card to drill down
7. LinkedIn account view loads with campaign breakdowns
8. Client clicks on specific campaign to see campaign details
9. Client exports data as CSV

### Flow 3: Admin Generates Shareable Link
1. Admin opens admin dashboard
2. Views list of companies
3. Clicks "Get Shareable Link" next to company name
4. Modal displays URL: `https://app.com/c/abc123`
5. Admin clicks "Copy Link"
6. Link copied to clipboard
7. Admin shares link with client via email/Slack

## Risk & Mitigation

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Expandi webhook changes format | High | Store raw webhook payload, version webhook processor |
| Database performance with millions of events | Medium | Add indexes, implement data archiving, use read replicas |
| Shareable URLs leaked publicly | Medium | Add optional password protection in Phase 2 |
| Webhook endpoint DDoS | Medium | Rate limiting, authentication token from Expandi |
| Client wants feature outside roadmap | Low | Clear scope documentation, phased roadmap |

---

## Documentation Requirements

All code must include:
- ✅ Inline comments explaining complex logic
- ✅ Function/component documentation
- ✅ README files in each major directory
- ✅ API documentation with example requests/responses
- ✅ Database schema documentation
- ✅ Deployment guides
- ✅ Troubleshooting section

---

## Maintenance Plan

### Regular Tasks
- Weekly: Review unassigned LinkedIn accounts
- Monthly: Database cleanup (archive old events)
- Quarterly: Performance review and optimization
- As needed: Update dependencies, security patches

### Monitoring
- Webhook processing success rate
- API response times
- Database query performance
- Error logs and stack traces
