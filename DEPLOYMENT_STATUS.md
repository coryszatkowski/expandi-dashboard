- **Date:** January 2025

## 🚧 CURRENT ISSUES

### 1. Railway PostgreSQL Connection Issues
- **Problem:** Database connection stability
- **Symptoms:** Intermittent connection failures
- **Impact:** Webhook processing, dashboard data loading
- **Status:** Active troubleshooting

## 🔧 DEVELOPMENT CLARIFICATION

**IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS:**
- ✅ Local development is fine to work on
- ⚠️ When discussing "server issues" - we mean PRODUCTION server issues
- ⚠️ Do NOT assume localhost issues when troubleshooting production problems
- 🔧 We ARE making changes to production - that's the current focus
- 📍 Production URLs: `api.dashboard.orionstrategy.com` and `dashboard.orionstrategy.com`

## 🤖 AI Agent Protocol

### Before Making Any Changes:
1. **Verify the issue exists** - Don't assume systems are broken
2. **Check your own connectivity** - DNS/network issues are common
3. **Ask the user** - "Are you experiencing issues with the production system?"
4. **Use correct URLs** - Always use `api.dashboard.orionstrategy.com`

### Common Mistakes to Avoid:
- ❌ Assuming custom domains don't work when you get DNS errors
- ❌ Falling back to Railway subdomains without checking
- ❌ Making "fixes" for systems that are actually working
- ❌ Confusing localhost issues with production issues

### When You Get Connection Errors:
1. Check if it's a temporary network issue
2. Verify the URL is correct
3. Ask the user to confirm system status
4. Don't assume the production system is broken

### 2. Production Environment Configuration
- **Problem:** Environment variables and configuration
- **Symptoms:** API endpoints not responding correctly
- **Impact:** Admin dashboard functionality
- **Status:** Under investigation

### 3. Webhook Endpoint Testing
- **Problem:** Production webhook endpoint validation
- **Symptoms:** Expandi webhooks not being processed
- **Impact:** No new data being captured
- **Status:** Testing in progress

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING CHECKLIST

### For New Developers

#### ⚠️ DO NOT:
- Work on local development while production issues are being resolved
- Make changes that could affect the live Railway deployment
- Test webhook endpoints without coordinating with the team
- Modify database schema without approval

#### ✅ DO:
- Check Railway logs for database connection errors
- Monitor webhook endpoint response times
- Verify environment variables are set correctly
- Test API endpoints individually

### Railway Troubleshooting

#### Check Database Connection
```bash
# Check Railway logs
railway logs

# Look for PostgreSQL connection errors
# Common errors:
# - "Connection terminated unexpectedly"
# - "Connection timeout"
# - "Database not found"
```

#### Verify Environment Variables
```bash
# Check Railway environment variables
railway variables

# Required variables:
# - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection string)
# - PORT (3001)
# - NODE_ENV (production)
# - FRONTEND_URL (Vercel URL)
```

#### Test Database Connection
```bash
# Test from Railway console
railway run node -e "
const { Pool } = require('pg');
const pool = new Pool({ connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL });
pool.query('SELECT NOW()', (err, res) => {
  if (err) console.error('DB Error:', err);
  else console.log('DB Connected:', res.rows[0]);
  pool.end();
});
"
```

### API Endpoint Testing

#### Test Webhook Endpoint
```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://backend-production-b2e1.up.railway.app/api/webhooks/expandi \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"test": "data"}'
```

#### Test Admin Endpoints
```bash
# Test admin login
curl -X POST https://backend-production-b2e1.up.railway.app/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "password"}'
```

#### Test Dashboard Endpoints
```bash
# Test dashboard endpoint (replace with actual share token)
curl https://backend-production-b2e1.up.railway.app/api/dashboard/test-token
```

## 📊 MONITORING

### Railway Metrics to Watch
- **Database Connections:** Should be stable
- **Response Times:** Should be < 2 seconds
- **Error Rates:** Should be < 1%
- **Memory Usage:** Should be stable

### Key Logs to Monitor
- Webhook processing logs
- Database connection logs
- API request logs
- Error stack traces

### Alerts to Set Up
- Database connection failures
- High error rates (> 5%)
- Response time degradation (> 5 seconds)
- Memory usage spikes

## 🔄 ROLLBACK PLAN

### If Critical Issues Occur
1. **Immediate:** Check Railway service status
2. **Database:** Verify PostgreSQL connection
3. **API:** Test all critical endpoints
4. **Frontend:** Verify Vercel deployment
5. **Webhooks:** Test webhook processing

### Emergency Contacts
